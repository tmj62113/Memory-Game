## Instructions
* Click on a card, continue to click on a cards until you find a match.
* Find all 8 pairs and your a winner!!
* Play again and try to find all matches in less time than before.



## How I built the Memory Game
* First I added some functionality to the deck of cards in the app.js file.
* Then I added the modal into index.html, app.css and app.js files.
* Then I fought with the modal for a very long time until it cooperated.
* I made it fancy by adding some css and media queries.
